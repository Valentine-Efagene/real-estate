This setup is to prepare the application for demos of the application flow. The button for it should also be in the current bootstrap section on the landing page.

These are the requirements for the demo bootstrap:

- A qshelter admin like Adaeze
- A qshelter mortgage_ops staff, Yinka.
- A customer like Emeka Okoro
- A developer organisation with onboarding completed by an agent staff Nneka
- All user emails are their first name @mailsac.com, like nneka@mailsac.com
- A bank organisation with onboarding completed by a mortgage_ops staff, Eniola
- The Nneka creates a property in published state. The property should have enough units for multiple tests (maybe 20)
- The 10/90 mortgage payment method, called MREIF.
  - Phases
    - Questionaire phase just asking no more than 5 questions, to be answered by the customer, and reviewed by qshelter
    - A documentation phase for the developer to upload a sales offer, to be accepted by the customer
    - A documentation phase (preapproval documentation) for the customer to upload preapproval documents (no more than 5). To be approved in two stages, qshelter and then the bank.
    - A payment phase where the customer pays 10% of the property price at 0 interest in a one-time payment
    - A documentation phase where the bank sends a mortgage offer for the customer to accept.
- Yinka links the payment method to the property Nneka created.
- The password for all the accounts must be 'password'
