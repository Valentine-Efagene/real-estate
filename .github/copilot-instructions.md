- Structure things into modules as much as possible.
- Use the `@nestjs/config` package to manage environment variables.
- Use `@nestjs/typeorm` for database interactions.
- Use `@nestjs/mailer` for sending emails.
- Don't worry about unit tests for now.
- Only focus on e2e tests, and give them clear user stories.
- Use `class-validator` and `class-transformer` for DTO validation and transformation.
- We intend to break the application into microservices in the future, so design with that in mind.
- Use TypeScript features like interfaces, types, and generics effectively.
- Follow NestJS best practices for folder structure, dependency injection, and module organization.
