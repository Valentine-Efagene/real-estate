- Structure things into modules as much as possible.
- Use the `@nestjs/config` package to manage environment variables.
- Use `@nestjs/typeorm` for database interactions.
- Use `@nestjs/mailer` for sending emails.
- Don't worry about unit tests for now.
- Only focus on e2e tests, and give them clear user stories.
- Use `class-validator` and `class-transformer` for DTO validation and transformation.
